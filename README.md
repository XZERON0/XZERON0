I'm a full stack developer, though I'm more of a front end developer, I'm most interested in game dev, yes and also, my favorite framework is django (python) ðŸŽ®

I know languages like: 
- python
- c#
- dart
- java
- javascript
- c++

Also, I can be too much of a perfectionist. Glad to meet you âœ¨
